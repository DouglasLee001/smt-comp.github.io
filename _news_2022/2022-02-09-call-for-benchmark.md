title: Call for benchmarks
newsdate: 2022-02-09

Have interesting or hard benchmarks that can be made public? Want the
world’s best SMT solvers to compete to solve your problems? Submit
your benchmarks to SMT-LIB and SMT-COMP!

Please let us know as soon as possible if you are considering submitting benchmarks, even if the material is not quite ready. We will work in close cooperation with the SMT-LIB maintainers to integrate such benchmarks into SMT-LIB. The deadline for submission of new benchmarks to be used in the 2022 competition is March 15, 2022.

If you have large complex benchmarks that are important to you and unsolved within some reasonable time limit, we are especially interested to see them. We will have again this year a parallel and a cloud track where solvers can use the combined power of multiple cores or machines to solve a single benchmark. We would particularly like benchmarks that come with a description of why they are difficult and important. Of course, new challenging benchmarks are always appreciated.

In your submission please follow [these guidelines](https://smt-comp.github.io/benchmark_submission.html).  Note that this is a different (but improved) process from previous years. If you have questions you can contact us or the SMT-LIB maintainers (contact information in the link above).

Sincerely,

The organizing team

* François Bobot, CEA List, France
* Jochen Hoenicke, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, Germany
