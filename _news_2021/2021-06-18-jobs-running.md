The SMT-COMP 2021 is live.  You can follow it on StarExec:

[https://www.starexec.org/starexec/secure/explore/spaces.jsp?id=443642](https://www.starexec.org/starexec/secure/explore/spaces.jsp?id=443642)

The Jobs were created in the spaces starting with `Competition`, one
for each track.  There will be more spaces for the remaining tracks
soon.

Note that the job summary is not always accurate:  Benchmarks with
unknown status are classified as unknown, even if the solver replied
with sat or unsat.  In the model validation track an error message in
the output is classified as wrong, even though our script classifies
it as unknown. We will use a script running on the Job Information
downloaded from the StarExec site and, especially in cases of
unsoundness, confirm manually whether the classification is correct or
not.
